# UI spec: what is built and what is not

`docs/spec/ui/` holds the Edit window UI spec: `SPEC.md`, the two mockups,
the design tokens and the generators. This note compares it with the app
as built (November 2026) and proposes a build order. The spec is the
source of truth for sizes, tokens and behaviour. The mockups are the
source of truth for look and placement.

## Already there underneath

Most of what the spec asks the UI to show already exists in the engine
and the document model. The work is mostly presentation.

| Spec area | Built today |
|---|---|
| One data model for both views | Yes. Composer and Sequencer read the same `ProjectData`. A piano-roll edit is written into the score, or kept as a performance override. |
| Transport, record, punch, loop takes, count-in | Yes (transport bar, recording, take lanes). |
| Instrument, MIDI, Audio, Aux tracks | `TrackKind` has Instrument, MidiOnly, Audio and Aux. Buses (group, FX, master) are separate. |
| Piano roll with velocity lane | Yes, as a bottom pane under the Sequencer. The spec puts it inline, in an expanded track. |
| Regions: trim, split, fade, gain, takes | Yes for audio clips. MIDI regions can be moved and notated, but have no trim or split yet. |
| Plug-in hosting, inserts, sends, PDC, automation | Yes: Read, Touch, Latch and Write, with lanes for every control. |
| Mixer with strips and master | Yes: the hardware-style console. |
| Print score to audio | Partly. Stem and mix bounces render offline to WAV, and any track can already hold audio clips. Nothing yet prints a track onto its own audio lane. |
| Parts and score export (Score stage) | Yes: PDF parts, full score PDF, MusicXML. |
| Markers, tempo map, meter map | Yes in the model. Chord symbols per bar are not stored yet. |

## Missing

### Look and shell (both views)

- Tokens as a runtime theme:
  - switchable `--led` and `--lcd` colours;
  - Dark or Paper staves;
  - the chassis, panel, keycap, LCD and LED recipes.
- Fonts: Barlow Condensed, Share Tech Mono and Inter (all SIL OFL) need
  to be embedded. Bravura is already embedded.
- Top deck:
  - nameplate with the Composer | Producer switch;
  - transport keys;
  - main counter LCD and start/end/length LCD;
  - Tempo, Meter and Key LCDs with Click, Count-in and Wait note;
  - master meters.
- The grouped toolbar with silkscreen labels.
- A four-row ruler (Bars|Beats, Markers, Chords, Tempo) and the overview
  strip with its draggable viewport.
- Stage bar: Compose › Score › Mix › Master.
- Status strip.

### Composer view

- Left rack: tracks with show/hide eyes, groups with LEDs, markers.
- Track header to spec:
  - number LCD and scribble strip;
  - R / S / M;
  - staff tag;
  - Volume and Pan knobs;
  - meter;
  - Ped and 8va on a grand staff.
- Phrase blocks: named, coloured ranges on a staff that can be dragged,
  trimmed, split, duplicated and renamed. The model has no such object
  yet; it needs one. Proposal: named, track-scoped ranges over the score,
  so moving a block moves its notes.
- Inspector:
  - selection LCD;
  - articulation and dynamics keys;
  - Velocity and Humanize ring knobs (these map onto performance
    overrides);
  - voice;
  - transpose.
- The 88-key keyboard deck:
  - key zoom from 1× to 3×, keeping the anchor note centred;
  - lit keys for the selection;
  - pitch and mod wheels;
  - octave shift;
  - step-input LCD.
- Engraving per the spec's geometry: 7 px staff space, 120 px per bar at
  100%, sticky clef zone and headers. The current Composer view uses the
  ported engraver's own layout.

### Producer view

- Lanes that expand and collapse per track:
  - mini notes on MIDI regions, waveforms on audio regions, automation;
  - the piano roll inline in an expanded track, instead of a bottom pane;
  - track heights resizable by dragging.
- The New track panel: type, count, mono or stereo.
- A Clips list in the left rack, with Import.
- Right panel: channel strip, the Print score to audio panel and the
  Master panel.
- Print to audio onto the instrument track's own audio lane (see
  Decisions; this replaces the spec's separate "<Track>_PRINT_01" Audio
  tracks), with the region growing while it records, real time as well
  as offline, and a progress LCD.
- Master panel:
  - integrated LUFS and true-peak meters;
  - master chain slots;
  - loudness target;
  - Export master to WAV, MP3 and FLAC, with dither on 16-bit.
- A Mixer deck at the bottom, with a tab back to the keyboard. The
  console is a separate window today.
- Producer toolbar:
  - Shuffle, Slip, Spot and Grid edit modes;
  - the Smart tool;
  - nudge;
  - quantize, input quantize and merge.
- MIDI CC lanes, consolidate, comping across MIDI takes.

## Decisions (November 13, 2026)

1. **One app, two views of the same data.** Composer and Producer are
   two tabs (two buttons) at the top of one window, over one project. The
   notation is the source; it renders to MIDI; Producer shows that MIDI.
   Switching keeps the playhead, selection, zoom and scroll. Shortcut:
   Ctrl+Tab on both platforms, plus Cmd+` on macOS, because macOS keeps
   Cmd+Tab for switching apps.
2. **Every instrument track carries its own audio.** In Producer view an
   instrument track has its MIDI lane and, under it in the same track, an
   audio lane. "Print to audio" records the track's instrument output onto
   that lane. It is not a separate Audio track. The track then plays
   MIDI, its printed audio, or both, and is mixed as one channel.
   - The model already allows this: any track version can hold audio
     clips, and the engine plays them.
   - What is new is the choice of source, the print path, and showing
     both lanes.
   - Plain Audio tracks (live recordings) and Aux tracks stay as they are.
3. **Note-value keys follow Finale and Sibelius**, which agree:
   - 1 is a 64th, 2 a 32nd, 3 a 16th, 4 an eighth, 5 a quarter, 6 a half,
     7 a whole and 8 a breve;
   - `.` is a dot and 0 is a rest;
   - this is the spec's own layout (7 whole … 2 32nd), extended to 1
     and 8;
   - the app's current reversed layout becomes a selectable profile.
4. **Ticks.** Editing and every display count 960 per quarter. The engine
   keeps 2880 inside, an exact factor of three. Musical time stays
   separate from the audio sample clock: they meet only through the tempo
   map, and audio stays placed in seconds.
5. **Licensing: free formats only for now.**
   - WAV for prints, bounces and the master.
   - FLAC is free (BSD-licensed and already inside JUCE), so it is
     allowed.
   - MP3 master export is wanted eventually but not now. It needs an
     encoder (LAME, LGPL), to be decided when the time comes.

## Build order (revised)

1. **Theme and base controls.** *Done (November 2026).* `desktop/src/ui/hw/`:
   - `HwTheme` holds the tokens and the runtime theme. LED, LCD and Dark
     or Paper staves are switched from View › Theme, repaint every window
     at once, and are remembered.
   - The three fonts are embedded.
   - `HwControls` has the panel, keycap (toggle, LED dot, glyphs, solid
     R/S/M), LED, LCD, small knob, ring knob (15 LEDs), meters (20 dB/s
     fall, 1.5 s peak hold), fader (+6 … −∞) and the pitch and mod
     wheels.
   - View › Control Gallery lays them out like the mockup's top deck and
     toolbar. The headless check photographs it in two themes and tests
     each control's behaviour.

   The original step 1 description: Tokens with runtime LED, LCD and Dark or
   Paper staff colours; the embedded fonts; and the controls: panel,
   keycap, LED, LCD, small knob, ring knob, meters, fader, wheel.
2. **The window shell with the two tabs.** Composer | Producer on the
   nameplate.
   - Top deck: transport, counters in 960-tick bars|beats|ticks,
     Tempo/Meter/Key LCDs, master meters.
   - Toolbar frame, left rack, edit window frame, right panel, bottom
     deck, status strip, stage bar.
   - Both tabs show the existing views inside the new shell first, so the
     app works at every step.
   - Switching keeps the playhead, selection, zoom and scroll.
3. **Shared selection and shortcuts.** One selection drives the counters,
   the inspector, the lit keys and both views. Add the shortcut table,
   with the Finale/Sibelius note values as the default profile.
4. **Composer view lanes to the spec:**
   - staff geometry;
   - sticky track headers and clef zone;
   - four-row ruler (bars, markers, chords, tempo) and the overview
     strip;
   - phrase blocks, with their data model;
   - selection in the LED colour;
   - the inspector (articulation, dynamics, Velocity and Humanize knobs on
     performance overrides, voice, transpose).
5. **The keyboard deck.** 88 keys, key zoom from 1× to 3× keeping the
   anchor centred, lit keys, step input, octave shift, pitch and mod
   wheels.
6. **Producer view tracks.**
   - One row per track: the instrument track's MIDI lane plus its own
     audio lane, plain Audio tracks and Aux tracks.
   - Expand and collapse, with the piano roll and velocity lane inline,
     and drag-to-resize.
   - Waveforms, automation lanes, the New track panel and the Clips list.
   - The choice of MIDI, audio or both per track.
7. **Print to audio**, onto the track's own audio lane:
   - per track or for several at once;
   - offline first, then real time;
   - selection or song, with or without effects;
   - 48 kHz / 24-bit WAV;
   - a progress LCD;
   - the instrument switched to its printed audio when done.
8. **Mix:** the channel strip in the right panel and the Mixer deck at the
   bottom, both on the existing console engine and its automation.
9. **Master:** live integrated LUFS and true peak, the master chain slots,
   a loudness target, and Export master to WAV and FLAC. MP3 waits for
   the encoder decision.
